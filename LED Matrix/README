FPGA based LED Matrix Display:
To design a system to control an LED matrix display using FPGA, allowing for displaying text, graphics, or animations with various effects.

Code 1: To select a particular column, row and iterate through the row at every 1s.
        
Things done:  To divide the on-board clock frequency (50 MHz) to produce 1s clock.
              leds are turned on iteratively in a particular column
