FPGA-based LED Matrix Display:
To design a system to control an LED matrix display using FPGA, allowing for displaying text, graphics, or animations with various effects.

Code 1: To select a particular column, or row and iterate through the row at every 1s.
        
Things done:  Divide the on-board clock frequency (50 MHz) to produce a 1s clock.
              LEDs are turned on iteratively in a particular column

Code 2: To display a single character using LED Matrix display. The character chosen to print is F

Things done:  Since the 1Hz clock is too slow for displaying a character, the scan frequency variable is introduced to increase the frequency
              400 Hz is chosen as the sample scan frequency. since there are 8 rows, we multiply by 8. Hence Leds are lit faster.
